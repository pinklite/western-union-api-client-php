 Good Day,
 
My sincere apology for contacting you through this form, but my circumstances leave me with no other choice. I am prayerfully leaving everything I have to you, hoping that you will respond positively and won’t betray my trust, too. I should introduce myself.
 
My name is Christabel Pennington. I am dying. I am 60 years old and was diagnosed with cancer about two years ago. I received a message from God to donate what I inherited from my late husband to you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives to use my husband’s hard earned funds for ungodly purposes. I will be going in for an operation, and I pray that I survive. I have decided to will the sum of Ј6,000,000 Pounds Sterling to you for the good work of the lord, children in need, the poor and to help the homeless. Presently, I have informed my Barrister of my decision to will these funds to you. My Barrister is Barr. Daniel Hamilton. Contact him through his email (barr.danielamilton@yahoo.co.uk) if you are interested in carrying out this task, so that he may arrange for and tell you how the funds will be released to you. The total amount will be released to you. I know I have never met you, but my heart tells me to do this for you, and I hope you are sincere. Ple
 ase contact my Barrister immediat
You can get any information you need from my Barrister.
 
He will report to me and answer in my stead.
 
God bless,
Mrs. Christabel Pennington

It is my pleasure to contact you for a business venture which I and my junoir   sister,intend to establish in your country. Though I have not met with you   before but I believe, one has to risk confiding in someone to succeed   sometimes in life. I am Raphael Kamara, the only son of late Chief Fredrick   Kamara, from Sierra Leone in west africa. My sources of your contact gave me   the courage and confidence to rely on you.

There is this amount of FIFTEEN Million US Dollars ($15.000.000.00) which my   late father deposited with a BANK in Abidjan Capital city of Cote d’Ivoire   which he wanted to used for his political ambition in our Country before he   was assassinated. Now I and my junior sister have decided to invest this   money in your country or anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and   political reasons.

We want you to help us claim and receive this money which will be transferred   to your safe bank account avoid any traces of the funds and to enable you   plan for the investment in your Country. I will like to invest part of the   money into these three investments in your Country but, if there is any other   business that is better than my suggestion, I will be very glad to follow   your advice.

1). Real estate
2). The transport industry
3). Five star hotel
If you can be of an assistance to us we will be pleased to offer to you 20%   Of the total fund while the balance will be invested by you. I await your   soonest response.

Respectfully yours,
